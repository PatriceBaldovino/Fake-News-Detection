# Fake News Classification Project  

## **Overview**  
The Fake News Classification Project is designed to tackle the growing problem of misinformation by determining whether a news article is real or fake. Using advanced machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP), this project provides a robust and reliable solution to identify and mitigate the impact of fake news. The project includes a user-friendly web interface, built using Flask, where users can input a news title and instantly view the classification results.
